                    Hi everybody, today I'm going to tell you how we created a beautiful romance game for mobile.
                    How we did it with a very tiny team and a small budget.
                    How we got featured by Apple.
                    Multiple times!
                    How we got published by PlugIn Digital!
                    How Google called us to help us do user acquisition!
                    And how all of this still wasn't enough for a success.

                    Yeah, this is the story of a commercial failure.
                    But there are some lessons you could learn from this.
                    Let's go back in time.

                    I'm Alexis Bauchu, I graduated from ENJMIN as a programmer in 2009.
                    I worked for about 5 years for Pretty Simple making casual games for FB and mobile.
                    I went on to develop tools at Days of Wonder, to help make tabletop games.
                    And finally I co-founded ButokaÃ¯ with my friend Constantin.

                    Constant was a writer at Pretty Simple.
                    One day he came to me, and that's roughly how it went: (read conversation).
                    He had worked for a japanese company making otome games and
                    found the production value lacking. He thought of all the nice
                    people he worked with in the past and thought he could build up
                    a team to make his own otome game.

                <h2>The market at the time</h2>
                <p>Few games translated to French, except:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It it Love? (1492)</li>
                    <li>(Tictales)</li>
                    <li>Amour SucrÃ© (Beemoov)</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    We studied what the market was offering: lots of games in english,
                    often poorly translated from another language. Rarely in French.
                    The quality varied a lot, most games looking fan-made.
                    Some had great main characters, like Is it Love, but usually
                    they had really poor backgrounds and worst UIs.

                <h2>Some numbers</h2>
                <p>Is it Love stats in 2016</p>
                <aside class="notes">
                    Despite the poor production value, those games were selling.
                    Thanks to great cast of characters and themes, and ease of use.
                    We thought: we can do even better than this.

            <section>
                <h2>The Concept</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mainly female audience</li>
                    <li>Hot BoyZ!!</li>
                    <li>Paris</li>
                    <li>Modern Day, relatable environment</li>
                    <li>Phone mode</li>
                    <li>Pretty graphics</li>
                    <li>"Straight to the point" story</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    So we started discussing what we wanted for the game.
                    From our competitors we kept: a female audience target,
                    the cast of cute boys surrounded by likable friends.
                    But we wanted to add a family aspect, give the whole thing a
                    "village feeling" (Plus belle la vie).
                    We also wanted to propose a different theme than the over used
                    business office romance, school drama and heroic-fantasy romance.
                    And we settled for: first job at a bakery in a charming neightboorhood.
                    We also wanted to paint a beautiful Paris. The one people see
                    in movies, not the actual one of course ðŸ˜œ

                <aside class="notes">
                    So in 2017 we started to assemble a crew of artists to help
                    us make the game real. You should go check-out their online content,
                    they are great.
